# Phishing Detection Extension

## Objective

For my Master's dissertation, I decided to combine my knowledge about machine learing with what I had learned during my master's and create a machine learning powered phishing detection extension.

### Skills Learned

- Developed and fine-tuned machine learning models for phishing website classification.
- Performed data scraping and feature extraction from raw website source code (HTML, JavaScript).
- Built and deployed a Chrome browser extension for real-time phishing detection.
- Integrated a backend ML model into browser extensions via RESTful APIs.
- Created an iOS-compatible extension and managed mobile-specific UI/UX constraints.
- Preprocessed and labeled large datasets for supervised learning tasks.
- Implemented lightweight ML inference pipelines optimized for client-side performance.
- Gained experience in cross-platform development and extension security best practices.
